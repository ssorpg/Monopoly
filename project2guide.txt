The Game of Monopoly - With a Twist

Minimum of 2 players

Players can enter their name for temporary registration.

Players can start taking turns when at least 2 players have entered.

On game start, a random event fires that changes the game permanently such as:
all properties cost twice as much, dice can only roll even numbers, all players start jailed, etc

Most game data will be stored in the database such as:
player money, player location, properties information (who purchased, for how much, houses/hotels on the property etc),
events fired/cards drawn (if some events can only fire once), etc

The board itself is an array of functions that are run on users when they land on a square

Properties to purchase are an array of objects stored in db that are modified when a player bids on them

Perhaps properties should be joined to users to show which user owns which properties

Order of completion:

User connection and registration
Put properties such as money held to users db
Players can win/lose the game
Board UI creation
Players can roll and move around the board
Random events and "when landed on" functions
Implement jail and get out of jail logic
